            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm a computer science student. Although my studies keep me busy most of the time, 
                I try to explore different aspects of computer science on my own. 
                When I'm not focused on university work, 
                I dive into the world of cyber security, either writing new exploits 
                (though I usually don't find the vulnerabilities myselfâ€”probably a skill issue) 
                or playing CTFs. Outside of cyber security, I tinker with whatever interests me, 
                often in the realm of privacy-focused coding. 
                However, I prefer not to limit myself to one specific area, as I enjoy exploring various topics.
