Hello, I'm gwydd!

I'm a computer science student, currently focused on software development and programming languages. 
Although my studies keep me quite busy, I still find time to tinker with Linux, compilers, interpreters and ctf challenges during my free time. 
I'm a passionate enthusiast of open-source development, free software, and internet privacy.

Aside from my technical pursuits, I also enjoy reading. 
At the moment, I'm reading "The Nausea" by Jean-Paul Sartre, exploring existentialism.

If you're wondering about the meaning behind "gwydd"â€”it's the Welsh word for "goose." 
I don't have any Welsh heritage (at least, none that I'm aware of), but I found the word amusing, and it stuck as my username.

A fun fact about this blog: it's built using the static site generator Hakyll. 
Even though I have no prior experience with the Haskell environment (the language Hakyll is written in), however, 
I took it as a chance to experiment with a new technology. This aligns with the whole motto of this blog:
to explore and tinker around.

And yes, as you can tell by the design of this site my designer skills and my taste is not particularly good.
