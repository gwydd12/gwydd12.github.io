A preface is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the author of the work. 
Although the writing of this blog will never be a book, nor can it be categorized as literature, I think it should have its own preface.

Although prefaces are usually written after the book is finished, 
I'm writing this as the first blog post to be published on this website. 
It gives me a starting point for this project, which I've had in mind for a couple of years.

This blog allows me to think deeply about my research, projects, ideas and much more, and to share them with the whole internet. 
The latter part excites me, as I can share my research with the whole internet and it might even help someone.

This blog will be a collection of several research interests that I am pursuing.
At the time of writing, this blog does not have a specific focus, but it will mostly be in the world of computer science.

So first of all I would like to thank everyone for visiting this website. 
I look forward to writing interesting articles about my work. Hopefully I'll be able to keep up with this project.

I would also like to thank all future contributors, interlocutors and proofreaders. 
If you have any feedback, questions, interest or just want to talk, please feel free to contact me.
