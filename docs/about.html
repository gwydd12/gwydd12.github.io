            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Hello, I’m gwydd!</p>
<p>I’m a computer science student, currently focused on software development and programming languages.
Although my studies keep me quite busy, I still find time to tinker with Linux, BSD, and privacy-focused projects during my free time.
I’m a passionate enthusiast of open-source development, free software, and internet privacy.</p>
<p>Aside from my technical pursuits, I also enjoy reading.
At the moment, I’m reading “The Nausea” by Jean-Paul Sartre, exploring existentialism.</p>
<p>If you’re wondering about the meaning behind “gwydd”—it’s the Welsh word for “goose.”
I don’t have any Welsh heritage (at least, none that I’m aware of), but I found the word amusing, and it stuck as my username.</p>
<p>A fun fact about this blog: it’s built using the static site generator Hakyll.
Even though I have no prior experience with Haskell (the language Hakyll is written in), however,
I took it as a chance to experiment with a new technology. This aligns with the whole motto of this blog:
to explore and tinker around.</p>
<p>And yes, as you can tell by the design of this site my designer skills and my taste is not particularly good.</p>
