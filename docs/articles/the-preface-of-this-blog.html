        <p>A preface is an introduction to a book or other literary work written by the author of the work.
Although the writing of this blog will never be a book, nor can it be categorized as literature, I think it should have its own preface.</p>
<p>Although prefaces are usually written after the book is finished,
I’m writing this as the first blog post to be published on this website.
It gives me a starting point for this project, which I’ve had in mind for a couple of years.</p>
<p>This blog allows me to think deeply about my research, projects, ideas and much more, and to share them with the whole internet.
The latter part excites me, as I can share my research with the whole internet and it might even help someone.</p>
<p>This blog will be a collection of several research interests that I am pursuing.
At the time of writing, this blog does not have a specific focus, but it will mostly be in the world of computer science.</p>
<p>So first of all I would like to thank everyone for visiting this website.
I look forward to writing interesting articles about my work. Hopefully I’ll be able to keep up with this project.</p>
<p>I would also like to thank all future contributors, interlocutors and proofreaders.
If you have any feedback, questions, interest or just want to talk, please feel free to contact me.</p>
